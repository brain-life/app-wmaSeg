    doesn't assume node spacing any more
    
    previously nodespacing was presumed to be 1.  This could lead to problems when using planar ROIs on fiber groups with internode distances greater than 2*minDist in (https://github.com/vistalab/vistasoft/blob/7253b379582613268b1ee6e2ae159ae60199e3dd/mrDiffusion/fiber/dtiIntersectFibersWithRoi.m#L61), where minDist was .87.  Now computes from average internode distance of streamline 1.  Has a bit of wiggle room with the use of .6 as a modifier of this distance.
